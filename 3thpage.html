        Another sort of stress is when I was trying to put this website online<br>
        through hosting called Firebase. However, in order to use Firebase<br>
        I must download Node.js and connected with Visual Studio Code. However,<br>
        I can’t find a way to do it. I was super nervous at that moment because<br>
        I thought I would not able to show you my coding TwT.<br>
        Fortunately, I found a web application called Netlify<br>
        that I can upload this website through Github:)<br><br>

        The next page will be the last page of this site.<br>
        I will conclude my feeling and thought about the process of coding. 

      </p>

      <script>
        function redirectUser() {
            var code = document.getElementById("code").value;
            if(code == "7"){
              window.location.href = "4thpage.html";
            }

            else{
              alert("Error: Code not found");
            }
          }
        </script>
          
          <p1 style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">

            However, as you know, in order for you to go to the next page<br> 
            we need to do some exercise. It’s just a math problem<br>
             from the SAT, so you probably be alright.<br><br>
            Q: If 3(2x-3) = 33 what is the value of x <br><br>
             
          <input type="text" id="code" placeholder="example : 5" size="25"><br>
        </p1>
  
  
  
          <button type="button" value="Go" onclick="redirectUser();">Submit</button>
