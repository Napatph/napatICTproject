        Alright You passed again.<br>
         Maybe I’ll just put a little bit harder question on the next one.<br><br>
        The stress come from two part of the programming.<br>
         First, it is the question and answer system that you just did.<br>
          It took me 2 days to figure it out how to deploy Javascript in HTML<br>
           becuase it's requires the “if, else, else if” code system<br>
            in the Javascript. Soon as I figure it out how to implement the code,<br>
             I am very grateful so I went outside to sweep the leaves.<br>
              If you are a programmer you might think that this is easy,<br>
               which it actually is. But...this is my first time though;)<br><br>

               In case you wonder how I started.<br>
                On both side of your screen is my lecture.
      </p>

      <script>
        function redirectUser() {
            var code = document.getElementById("code").value;
            if(code == "HTML"){
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }
            else if(code == "html"){
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }

            else if (code == "CSS") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }
            else if (code == "css") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }

            else if (code == "Javascript") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }
            else if (code == "javascript") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }

            else{
              alert("Well, look like you cannot answer it. \n The programming language that I use are HTML, CSS, and Javascript ");
            }
          }
        </script>
          
        <p1 style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">

            This question is not the hardest,<br> 
            but you need some historical knowledge.<br>
             The question is which country gave<br>
              the statue of liberty to the US as a gift<br><br>
        <input type="text" id="code" placeholder="example : Germany, Britain, Canada" size="25"><br>
        </p1>
  
        <p2>
          Don't worry if you cannot answer.<br> The answer will show in the alert box.<br><br>
        </p2>
  


        <button type="button" value="Go" onclick="redirectUser();">Submit</button>
