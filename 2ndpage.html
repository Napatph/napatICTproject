        Alright You passed again...<br>
         Maybe I’ll just put a little bit harder question on the next one.<br><br>
        The stress come from two part of the programming.<br>
         First, it is the question and answer system that you just did.<br>
          It took me 2 days to figure it out how to deploy Javascript in HTML<br>
           because it's requires the “if, else, else if” code system<br>
            in the Javascript. Soon as I figure it out how to implement the code,<br>
             I am very grateful so I went outside to sweep the leaves.<br>
              If you are a programmer you might think that this is easy,<br>
               which it actually is. But...this is my first time though;)<br><br>

               
      </p>

      <script>
        function redirectUser() {
            var code = document.getElementById("code").value;
            if(code == "France"){
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }
            else if(code == "france"){
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }

            else if (code == "French") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }
            else if (code == "french") { 
              window.location.href = "3thpage.html";
            }

            else{
              alert("Nooo that was incorrect.\nThe country that gave the statue of liberty to the US is France.");
            }
          }

        <p1 style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">

            This question is not the hardest,<br> 
            but you need some historical knowledge.<br>
             The question is which country gave<br>
              the statue of liberty to the US as a gift<br><br>
        <input type="text" id="code" placeholder="example : Germany, Britain, Canada" size="35">

          Don't worry if you cannot answer.<br> The answer will show in the alert box.<br><br>
