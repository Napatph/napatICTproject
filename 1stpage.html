      Congratulation! You passed the first question, so I’ll tell you the journey:)<br><br>
      This website was start programed on June 5th and finished on June 10th.<br>
       I spent approximately 40 hours in order to build this website.<br>
        I admit that I spent half of the time sitting stressed,<br>
         but I need to admit another thing that I am actually enjoy coding:)<br><br>

         The stress come from two part of the programming.<br>
          But before I tell you about the causes of the stress,<br>
           you need to answer the following question.
      
    </p>
      
      <script>
        function redirectUser() {
            var code = document.getElementById("code").value;
            if(code == "1991"){
              window.location.href = "2ndpage.html";
            }
            
            else{
              alert("Nope! it was not the year\n It was 1991 when Python was invented");
            }
          }
        </script>



      <p1 style = "text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">

        The question is what is the year when<br>
         Python(the programming language) was invented?<br><br>
        <input type="text" id="code" placeholder="example : 1987" size="25"><br>
      </p1>

      <p2>
        Don't worry if you cannot answer.<br> The answer will show in the alert box.<br><br>
      </p2>

        <button type="button" value="Go" onclick="redirectUser();">Submit</button>
