      When I say ‘I am enjoy coding’ it doesn’t mean that it has no stress,<br> 
      it means I enjoy the process of learning programming. I do self-learning <br>
      through watching videos from Youtube, searching Google for 11 years old <br>
      threads in Stackoverflow, and learning new subjects from w3school. This is <br>
      probably not the best website that you have ever seen, but the process of <br>
      everything I've done has taught me that I have what it takes to study at <br>
      the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University:) <br><br><br>
